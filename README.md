# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-Bidirectional-LSTM

In this notebook, stock market data, particularly for NVDA stocks, will be examined. The stock information will be retrieved using pandas, and different aspects will be visualized. Risk analysis based on historical performance will be conducted, and future stock prices will be predicted using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method.<br>

Following parst will be covered along the way:<br>

1. Data Acquisition<br>
2. Data Preprocessing <br>
3. Model Selection and Training<br>
4. Evaluation and Prediction<br>
5. Visualization
